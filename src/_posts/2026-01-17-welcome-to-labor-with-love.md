Hello and welcome to Labor with Love! I'm Rebecah Hatchel, and I'm so glad you've found your way here.

After years of supporting families through birth and the postpartum period, I'm excited to launch this space where I can share resources, birth stories (with permission, of course!), and insights to help you on your journey into parenthood.

## Why "Labor with Love"?

The name says it all. Birth work is, quite literally, a labor of love—both for the families I serve and for me as a doula. Every birth I attend reminds me why I chose this path: to witness the incredible strength of birthing people and to provide unwavering support during one of life's most profound moments.

## What You'll Find Here

On this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Educational resources** about pregnancy, birth, and postpartum
- **Tips for preparing** for labor and delivery
- **Information about doula support** and how it can benefit you
- **Local Rochester resources** for expecting and new families
- **Personal reflections** on birth work and the lessons I've learned

## Let's Connect

Whether you're newly pregnant, planning your third birth, or just curious about doula support, I'd love to hear from you. Every birth story is unique, and I'm here to help you write yours with confidence and joy.

Feel free to reach out with questions, or schedule a free consultation to chat about your birth plans. I can't wait to meet you!

*With love and support,*
*Rebecah*
