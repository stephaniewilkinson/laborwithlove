One of the best things you can do to prepare for labor is to practice comfort measures before the big day. When you're in the midst of contractions, you'll be glad these techniques feel familiar!

Here are five comfort measures I recommend practicing during pregnancy:

## 1. Deep Breathing

Slow, deep breaths help activate your parasympathetic nervous system—the "rest and digest" response that counteracts stress and tension.

**How to practice:**
- Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 counts
- Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6-8 counts
- Focus on making your exhale longer than your inhale
- Practice for 5-10 minutes daily

During labor, this breathing pattern can help you stay calm and relaxed between contractions.

## 2. Position Changes

Your body is designed to move during labor! Different positions can help your baby descend and rotate, while also providing relief from discomfort.

**Positions to try:**
- Hands and knees (great for back labor!)
- Slow dancing with your partner
- Sitting on a birth ball
- Lunging with one foot elevated
- Side-lying with a pillow between your knees

Practice moving between these positions so they feel natural when labor begins.

## 3. Counter-Pressure

Many laboring people find that firm pressure on their lower back or hips provides significant relief, especially during back labor.

**How to practice:**
- Have your partner place the heel of their hand on your lower back or sacrum
- Apply firm, steady pressure
- Experiment with different locations and amounts of pressure
- Try using a tennis ball for targeted pressure

This is a great technique for birth partners to practice so they know exactly what feels good to you.

## 4. Water Therapy

Warm water is incredibly soothing during labor. Whether it's a shower, bath, or birth pool, water can help you relax and cope with contractions.

**How to practice:**
- Take warm baths during pregnancy
- Practice your breathing while in the water
- Let the warm water run over your belly and lower back in the shower

Many of my clients find that getting in the water during labor provides immediate relief!

## 5. Vocalization

Making sounds during contractions can help you release tension and cope with intensity. Low, open sounds are most effective.

**How to practice:**
- Practice making low "ohhh" or "ahhh" sounds
- Keep your jaw relaxed and open
- Try humming or moaning
- Remember: low sounds = open, relaxed muscles

Don't be shy about practicing! It might feel silly at first, but vocalizing can be incredibly powerful during labor.

## Practice Makes Perfect

The key to using these comfort measures effectively is making them second nature. When you're deep in labor, you won't want to think about *how* to breathe or *where* to apply pressure—you'll want these techniques to be automatic.

I encourage you to practice these with your birth partner so they know how to support you. And of course, as your doula, I'll be there to remind you of these techniques and help you find what works best in the moment.
