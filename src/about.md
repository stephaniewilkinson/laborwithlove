## My Journey to Becoming a Doula

Hello! I'm Rebecah Hatchel, and I'm honored to serve families in Rochester, New York as a DONA-certified birth and postpartum doula.

My path to doula work began with my own birth experiences, which opened my eyes to the profound impact that continuous, compassionate support can have during one of life's most transformative moments. I realized that every birthing person deserves to feel heard, supported, and empowered.

## What is a Doula?

A doula is a trained professional who provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational support before, during, and shortly after childbirth to help families achieve the healthiest, most satisfying experience possible.

As [DONA International](https://www.dona.org/) founder often says: *"If a doula were a drug, it would be unethical not to use it."*

[Scientific research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483123/) consistently shows that doula care leads to remarkably improved physical and psychological outcomes for both birthing people and their babies. Doulas have a positive impact on the well-being of the entire family.

Research shows that having a doula can lead to:
- Shorter labor
- Reduced need for pain medication
- Lower rates of cesarean birth
- More positive birth experiences
- Better breastfeeding outcomes

## My Certification

I am proud to be certified through **[DONA International](https://www.dona.org/)**, the oldest and largest doula certifying organization in the world. DONA has been training professional doulas for over 25 years and maintains rigorous standards for certification.

My DONA certification means I have:
- Completed an approved doula training workshop
- Attended and supported multiple births
- Received positive evaluations from clients and healthcare providers
- Passed a comprehensive certification process
- Committed to DONA's Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics
- Engaged in ongoing continuing education

## My Approach

Like a travel guide in a foreign country, I help support new families through the life-changing experience of having a baby. Whether it's your first baby or your fifth, I'm here to make your birth and postpartum experience better.

I believe that birth is a deeply personal experience, and my role is to support *your* vision for your birth—whatever that looks like. Whether you're planning an unmedicated birth, scheduling a cesarean, or somewhere in between, I'm here to:

- **Listen** to your hopes, fears, and preferences
- **Educate** you about your options so you can make informed decisions
- **Support** you with comfort measures and continuous presence during labor
- **Advocate** for your wishes with your medical team
- **Nurture** you and your family in the postpartum period

## Let's Connect
