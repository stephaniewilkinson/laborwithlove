## My Journey to Becoming a Doula

Hello! I'm Rebecah Hatchel, and I'm honored to serve families in Rochester, New York as a DONA-certified birth doula.

As a mother of four, my path to doula work began with my own birth experiences. Each of my births taught me something new about the profound impact that continuous, compassionate support can have during one of life's most transformative moments. I realized that every birthing person deserves to feel heard, supported, and empowered—and that too often, they don't get the advocacy they need.

Beyond my personal journey through pregnancy and birth, I bring years of experience working with children and youth. From infant care through adolescence, I've dedicated my career to supporting families at every stage. This extensive background in childcare gives me a deep understanding of the transition into parenthood and the realities of life with little ones.

## What is a Doula?

A doula is a trained professional who provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational support before, during, and shortly after childbirth to help families achieve the healthiest, most satisfying experience possible.

As [DONA International](https://www.dona.org/) founder often says: *"If a doula were a drug, it would be unethical not to use it."*

[Scientific research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483123/) consistently shows that doula care leads to remarkably improved physical and psychological outcomes for both birthing people and their babies. Doulas have a positive impact on the well-being of the entire family.

Research shows that having a doula can lead to:
- Shorter labor
- Reduced need for pain medication
- Lower rates of cesarean birth
- More positive birth experiences
- Better breastfeeding outcomes

## My DONA Certification

I am proud to be certified through **[DONA International](https://www.dona.org/become-a-doula/birth-doula-certification/)**, the oldest and largest doula certifying organization in the world. DONA has been training professional doulas for over 25 years and maintains rigorous standards for certification, with more than 13,000 certified doulas in over 50 countries worldwide.

## Proudly Supporting LGBTQ+ Families

As a member of the LGBTQ+ community myself, I understand the unique joys and challenges that queer and trans families may face on their path to parenthood. Rochester has a vibrant and growing LGBTQ+ community, and I'm honored to be part of it.

I provide affirming, inclusive care for all families, including:
- **Same-sex couples** navigating conception, pregnancy, and birth
- **Trans and non-binary parents** seeking gender-affirming birth support
- **Chosen families** of all configurations
- **Single parents by choice** within the LGBTQ+ community

Every family deserves a doula who sees them, respects them, and celebrates them. I'm committed to creating a safe, welcoming space where you can be fully yourself throughout your birth journey.

## My Approach

Like a travel guide in a foreign country, I help support new families through the life-changing experience of having a baby. Whether it's your first baby or your fifth, I'm here to make your birth and postpartum experience better.

I believe that birth is a deeply personal experience, and my role is to support *your* vision for your birth—whatever that looks like. Whether you're planning an unmedicated birth, scheduling a cesarean, or somewhere in between, I'm here to:

- **Listen** to your hopes, fears, and preferences
- **Educate** you about your options so you can make informed decisions
- **Support** you with comfort measures and continuous presence during labor
- **Advocate** fiercely for your wishes with your medical team
- **Nurture** you and your family in the postpartum period

### Your Voice, Amplified

**Advocacy is my greatest strength.** I've seen too many birthing parents feel unheard or dismissed during one of the most vulnerable moments of their lives. I'm here to ensure that doesn't happen to you. I help you understand your options, ask the right questions, and communicate your needs clearly—so that your voice is always at the center of your birth experience.

## Let's Connect

I'd love to learn about your story and discuss how I can support your journey into parenthood. Whether you're just starting to explore your options or you're ready to build your birth team, I'm here for you.
